        <h2>Enhancements to Voice</h2>
        <p>
          Voice access works right when you start your PC. Turn on voice access
          from the accessibility flyout box on the Lock screen. To turn it on
          automatically, go to <b>Settings > Accessibility > Speech.</b>Choose
          the setting to “Start voice access before you sign in to your PC.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The voice access has become more flexible and supports interaction
          with more user interface (UI) controls. For example, voice now
          interacts with controls that contain:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Names that have numbers, such as “Click 5”.</li>
          <li>
            Names without whitespaces between them, such as “click PivotTable”
            or “click PivotChart”.
          </li>
          <li>
            Names that have special characters, such as Bluetooth & devices
            (“click Bluetooth and devices”) or Dial–up (“click dial hyphen up”).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Additionally, voice supports spin controls, thumb controls, and split
          buttons. You interact with these controls by using the “click” command
          or number overlays. You can also use voice to scroll to the extreme
          left and right on a page. For more information about the new voice
          access commands, see
